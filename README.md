# Basic webpack test project

This project was modified to explore using Webpack to pack together node dependencies so there is a single file to zip up.

### Installation
```
git clone https://github.com/geocolumbus/webpack-basic-notes.git
npm install
```

### Build
```
npm run build
```

### Run locally
```
npm start
```

## Features

* webpack
* uglify.js
* serve
* babel
* karma / jasmine testing

## TODO (10/31/2018)

* Hot loading (integrate build and run if any changes)
* Hot testing (with headless chrome?)
* Allow environment to be set from command line
* Fix security alerts
* Add Github features (TravisCI ?)

## Reference

* For setting up testing, [this blog](http://www.thinksincode.com/2016/07/07/karma-jasmine-webpack.html) was helpful
